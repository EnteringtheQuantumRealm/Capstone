Introduction
1.1 Description of the Problem
Brooklyn is on the rise while The Bronx seems unfortunately in decline.

One of my collegue has to move into the Bronx who have been in Brooklyn for a long time. For my collegue who need to choose new neighborhood in the new city, I make up my mind to give a real insight between the two cities: Brooklyn VS the Bronx.

Also, Brooklyn and The Bronx have their own unique characteristic. I believe that exploring and comparing these two cities would be interesting.
By discovering how similar or dissimilar they are, I will give a real insights for my colleague.

1.2 Background
Brooklyn and The Bronx are very different. They don't mix like oil and water.

One reason is that Staten Island aside, which is totally separate and apart, The Bronx and Brooklyn are the two most geographically distant boroughs. Just as a matter of time and distance, residents of the two boroughs rarely mix.

The basic difference is that Brooklyn and The Bronx developed differently. Brooklyn has its own separate and independant identity as a city. For much of its existence as one of the largest in the country. Even as a borough, it would qualify as the 3rd or 4th largest city in the USA.

The city of Brooklyn developed in parralell to the City of New York, rivaling NYC until they merged, evidenced by Brooklyn's downtown and Brownstone Belt. Also, the outlying areas of Brooklyn (before Brooklyn was consolidated) were well developed and prosperous, such as Flatbush, Bushwhich, and the other Dutch towns.

The Bronx was an outlying area of mostly farmland and remained this way for most of its existence, until the subway was extended to the south bronx area. Afterwhich, The Bronx, unlike Brooklyn, developed with dense neighborhoods of mostly apartment buildings in which the masses of the lower east side expunged upon.
